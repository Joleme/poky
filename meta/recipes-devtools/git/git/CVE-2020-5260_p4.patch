+Git v2.17.4 Release Notes
+=========================
+
+This release is to address the security issue: CVE-2020-5260
+
+Fixes since v2.17.3
+-------------------
+
+ * With a crafted URL that contains a newline in it, the credential
+   helper machinery can be fooled to give credential information for
+   a wrong host.  The attack has been made impossible by forbidding
+   a newline character in any value passed via the credential
+   protocol.
+
+Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to Felix Wilhelm of Google
+Project Zero.
